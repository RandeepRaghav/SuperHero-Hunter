# SuperHero-Hunter

In this proect, I've created a Superhero Search App using the Fetch API in JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS. This project will allow users to search for superheroes and display their information using data retrieved from a superhero API.

To start, first set up the development environment by creating the necessary HTML structure and linking the CSS and JavaScript files.

Next, explore how to use the Fetch API to make HTTP requests to the superhero API. It handles user input by capturing the search query and dynamically construct the URL for the API request. It will then fetch the superhero data and display it on the webpage.

Next design the user interface using HTML and style it using CSS. Then create a search bar, a results section, and a card layout to present the superhero information. Applying CSS styling to make app visually appealing.

As users type in the search bar, it will update the search query dynamically and fetch the superhero data based on their input. It will handle different scenarios, such as displaying a loading spinner while the data is being fetched and handling errors in case the API request fails.

So this is the functional Superhero Search App that allows us to search for superheroes and retrieve their information using the Fetch API in JavaScript.
